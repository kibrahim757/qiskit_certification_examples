    "### **Advanced Building Blocks: Other Arithmetic Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the fundamental operations of addition, multiplication, and functional rotations, Qiskit's circuit library is equipped with a variety of other specialized arithmetic components. These gates and circuits are essential building blocks for constructing sophisticated quantum algorithms, particularly in the fields of optimization, finance, and solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other generalized operations, Qiskit provides these functions in two forms: abstract `Gate` representations, which describe the mathematical operation for the transpiler to optimize, and concrete `QuantumCircuit` implementations, which are ready-to-use algorithmic blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Quantum Reciprocal: A Key to Solving Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications of quantum computing is its potential to solve large systems of linear equations, a task central to countless problems in science and engineering. The famous **HHL algorithm** (named after Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd) achieves this by, in part, calculating the reciprocal of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`ExactReciprocalGate`**: This abstract `Gate` represents the function `f(x) = 1/x`. It is designed to compute the exact reciprocal for an integer `x`. This operation is non-trivial to implement on a quantum computer and is a critical subroutine for algorithms that need to perform division or matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`ExactReciprocal`**: This is the concrete `QuantumCircuit` implementation of the exact reciprocal algorithm. It provides a specific circuit that performs this calculation, which can be directly composed with other parts of a larger quantum program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Quantum Decision-Making: The Integer Comparator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms, both classical and quantum, rely on conditional logic—the ability to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is met. A fundamental building block for this is a comparator.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`IntegerComparatorGate`**: This `Gate` performs a comparison between the integer value encoded in a quantum register and a given classical integer. It can be configured to check for conditions like \"greater than or equal to\" (`>=`) or \"less than\" (`<`). The result of the comparison is typically flipped on a separate \"result\" qubit, which can then be used as a control for subsequent operations, effectively creating a quantum \"if\" statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`IntegerComparator`**: The `QuantumCircuit` that provides a specific implementation of the integer comparison logic. This is an essential tool for algorithms in quantum finance (e.g., comparing a stock price to a strike price) and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Optimization's Core: Evaluating Quadratic Forms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the most challenging and valuable optimization problems—from logistics and scheduling to financial modeling and drug discovery—can be mathematically formulated as finding the minimum value of a **quadratic form**. These are often expressed as **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)** problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`QuadraticFormGate`**: This abstract `Gate` is designed to evaluate a quadratic function on binary variables that are encoded in quantum registers. The function is of the general form `Q(x) = xᵀAx + bᵀx`, where `x` is a vector of binary variables (represented by qubits), `A` is a matrix, and `b` is a vector. This gate encodes the value of `Q(x)` into the phase of the quantum state, making it a powerful tool for use with algorithms like Quantum Phase Estimation to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`QuadraticForm`**: The concrete `QuantumCircuit` implementation that builds the circuit for evaluating the quadratic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Calculating Value: The Weighted Sum**\n",
    "\n",
    "While a standard adder computes `a + b`, many applications require the calculation of a **weighted sum**, such as `Σ(wᵢ * xᵢ)`, where each input variable `xᵢ` is multiplied by a specific weight `wᵢ`. This is fundamental to tasks like calculating the value of a financial portfolio or the output of a linear machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`WeightedSumGate`**: This abstract `Gate` represents the operation of computing the weighted sum of several quantum registers. You provide the list of weights, and the gate defines the mathematical transformation that adds these weighted values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`WeightedAdder`**: This is the corresponding `QuantumCircuit` that implements the weighted sum operation. It takes multiple quantum registers as input and adds their values, scaled by the provided weights, into an output register."
