    "### Three Execution Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Quantum provides three distinct execution modes for running quantum programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Job Mode** (`mode=backend`)\n",
    "   - Single request of Sampler or Estimator without a context manager\n",
    "   - Simplest mode for one-off executions\n",
    "   - Specify `mode=backend` when initializing the primitive \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Mode** (`mode=batch`)\n",
    "   - Multi-job workload made up of independently executable jobs, no condoitional relations to each other\n",
    "   - Jobs are scheduled together for efficiency\n",
    "   - Not gauranteed to run in order of submission, may run in parallel to other users jobs , QPU calibriation jobs may also run between batched jobs\n",
    "   - Queuing time doesn't decrease for the first job submitted in a job\n",
    "   - Specify `mode=batch` when initializing the primitive\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Session Mode** (`mode=session`)\n",
    "   - Dedicated window to run a multi-job workload\n",
    "   - execlusive access to the QPU and other jobs can run including calibriation jobs\n",
    "   - Particularly useful for iterative tasks that require frequent communication between classical and quantum resources\n",
    "   - Queuing time doesn't decrease for the first job submitted in a job\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use batch mode by default, especially when all inputs are ready, it is more cost-effective than sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch mode is ideal for submitting multiple primitive jobs at once to reduce total runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Session mode is best for iterative workflows or when dedicated QPU access is required, but it is generally more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Job mode should be used only for a single primitive request.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Plan users cannot use sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each job has fixed overhead. If a job uses less than 1 minute of QPU time, combine multiple tasks into a single job.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If jobs take more than 1 minute or cannot be combined, submit multiple jobs in batch or session mode to exploit parallel classical processing (up to 5 jobs), even though the QPU runs one job at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tune workload size and parallelism specially in sessions to minimize wall-clock time and cost; splitting large jobs can be more efficient."
